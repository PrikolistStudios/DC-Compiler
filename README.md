# Simplified C Compiler

This is a school assignment: I had to design a simple programming language and impolement compiler and interpreter for it. To achieve this I created a grammar, documentation, user guide and a compiler written on C++.

The language itself is basically very very simplified C++. It has expressions, functions, arrays and main operands.

This task included development of the syntactical analyzer, lexical analyzer, semantical analyzer, generation of the POLIZ and execution of it.

Language grammar: [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18fD-_uEB8KPHSCcVivuVTcengJ7GwI7QYHwMduGnoYU/edit?usp=sharing) - the link doesn't work and sadly the grammar was lost :(

Documentation: found in corresponding folder

User Guide: [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JmhIEp3QHfGOcCv969SrRJSwFa2hT2or/view)

Here you can only find the code for the project, and no build instructions or anything. This was not a concern when I developed this project.
