# Simplified C Compiler

This is a school assignment: I had to design a simple programming language and impolement compiler and interpreter for it. To achieve this I created a grammar, documentation, user guide and a compiler written on C++.

The language itself is basically very very simplified C++. It features:
 - Fundamental arithmetic types
 - Characters and strings
 - Arrays
 - Functions and recursion
 - Structures with plain data *and methods*
 - Basic IO

The compiler features are:
 - Lexical analyzer
 - Syntactical analyzer
 - Semantical analyzer
 - Compiles code into more interpretable form (see [Generated POLIZ](SyntacticalAnalyzer/poliz.txt))
 - Interpreter that takes generated POLIZ and executes it


This task included development of the syntactical analyzer, lexical analyzer, semantical analyzer, generation of the POLIZ and execution of it.

Documentation: found in corresponding [folder](./Documentation).

User Guide: [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JmhIEp3QHfGOcCv969SrRJSwFa2hT2or/view).

Here you can only find the (really bad) code for the project, and no build instructions or anything. This was not a concern when I developed this project.
